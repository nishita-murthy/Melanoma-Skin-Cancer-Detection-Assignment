# Melanoma Detection Assignment

## Problem Statement 

To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

The data set contains the following diseases:

* Actinic keratosis
* Basal cell carcinoma
* Dermatofibroma
* Melanoma
* Nevus
* Pigmented benign keratosis
* Seborrheic keratosis
* Squamous cell carcinoma
* Vascular lesion

### Steps involved in this notebook:
    
Step 1: Importing the data  
Step 2: Load using keras.preprocessing  
Step 3: Visualize the data  
Step 4: Model building - I  
Step 5: Train the model - I  
Step 6: Model building - II  
Step 7: Train the model - II  
Step 8: Train the model - III

**Final insights of the assignment**
* The model has an improvement in terms of accuracy at the end of assignment however, it's still overfitting.
* We can add more layers, dropout layers or neurons to overcome this issue.
* The hyperparameters may be tweaked to improve the model even further.
